Many years ago in forgotten ages,
there lived an ancient people
who achieved mastery over all the earth
and built many things of wonder.

But their most wondrous achievement
was the construction of the Tower -
a structure of immeasurable proportion
linking together the earth and its moon.

Legends say that those ancient people
grew capricious and careless in their mastery,
and in despair, they abandoned the earth
when it first started to die.

Now with its mythical creators long vanished
and the means to control it lost to time,
the crumbling Tower stands dark and silent,
yet still reaching upward seemingly forever.

But there are those who say that the Tower
can still be traversed, and that the key
to reviving the earth lies at the other end
of that labyrinthine aethereal path...


for some unremembered purpose.

betwixt the earth and its moon...


Many years ago in forgotten ages,
there was an ancient people
who were tired of the pain and strife
in this world, and resolved to flee.
They prayed for divine intervention,
but their gods did not respond.
Bereft of faith, they decided
to take destiny upon themselves.
They abandoned the earth
and built a path to the moon.
 
One evening you find yourself face to face
with a tower of immeasurable proportion.
It extends upward seemingly forever,
fading into the dark-blue starlit sky.
